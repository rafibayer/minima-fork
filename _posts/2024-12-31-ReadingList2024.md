As you can probably tell from the lack of posts, blogging was not my priority this past year! Between my new job and some personal issues, I didn't get to do too much programming in my spare time. I did, however, make time for more reading. Rather than trying to Provide a review or score, I'll annotate books I especially enjoyed with a __*__.

I know you all waited with baited breath, so here it is, the short (but slightly longer) list of books I read in 2024!
