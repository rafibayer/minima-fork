Hi, I'm Rafi. I am a Software Engineer II with the Microsoft Azure Networking team. I work primarily on the performance and scalability of the networking control plane, reducing resource deployment times and increasing reliability for our customers. Prior to joining Microsoft, I graduated with a degree in Informatics from the University of Washington (go dawgs).

This site is my personal blog, I mostly plan on covering side projects of mine in greater detail.
