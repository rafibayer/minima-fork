And now for something different!  
Early this year, I became the proud owner of a Kindle. I thought it might be nice to replace some of the [Doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) with reading (Doom... turning?). 

Without further ado, behold, the short list of books I read in 2023!

Hey! If you found this section in the source, it's still a work in progress! I'll finish the rest of the writeup as time allows :)

While I enjoyed each of these books, I want to pick out a few that I found particularly good, and that I think are probably worth your time. 

## The End of the World Is Just the Beginning
As the title suggests, this nonfiction work by Zeihan forecasts the collapse of much of the world as we know it. Zeihan focuses on a few key areas, namely transportation, finance, energy, industrial materials, manufacturing, and agriculture. He describes how each of these sectors will be impacted by his described "collapse of globalization".  

Sounds boring? Surprisingly not, Zeihan's prose is very engaging and quite funny, even when discussing downright morbid topics. This book provides a unique and interesting perspective on politics and economics. Even if you ultimately don't buy his pessimistic outlook, I believe this book is still very much worth reading for the in-depth historical context it provides to the modern world system. 

## A Short Stay In Hell
This book is short, clocking in at around 100 pages. In short, this novel follows the experiences of a ordinary man who dies and finds himself in hell, but it manifests in a completely unique and unexpected way.
